# Joy_Criminology

## Introduction:
The sun was the same as it had been the day I'd buried Maman, and like then, my forehead especially was hurting me all the veins in it throbbing under the skin...My whole being tensed and I squeezed my hand around the revolver. 
-Albert Camus, The Stranger-

## Data
2000 ~ 2019, State-level datasets from the following sources:
- Pollution Data: Air pollution data from EPA on major pollutants. 
- Crime Data: General crimes (violent crimes and property crimes) and Hate Crimes from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
Control Variables:
- Demographic Variables (Population, Median age, percentage of male population, percentage of White population, Percentage of population who completed at least some college) and Economic Variables (Per capita income and unemployment rate)


## Findings
- Sun exposure is linked to a rise in overall crime rates but correlates with a decrease in hate crimes.
- A higher percentage of White population is associated with lower violent and property crime rates but shows a positive correlation with hate crimes.
- Educational attainment is inversely related to general crime rates, while it exhibits a positive correlation with hate crime incidents.
